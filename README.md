Here are some Mods for Discord Bot Maker! 

We will add more info to this readme asap!

Make sure to join the DBM MODS DISCORD SERVER. To stay updated and be able to suggest things! https://discord.gg/Y4fPBnZ

Install and Update Mods:

We suggest that you install Yarn if you plan on adding this to DBM itself.

    npm install -g yarn


then just run

    yarn add dbmmods


In your bot and in DBM. Sometimes running `npm install` in DBMs main directory causes npm to remove all of the node modules
thats why we suggest that you install and use [Yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn)

----

If you don't run your bot with DBM make sure to copy this actions to your bot directory too!
And if you have any more questions: Join the Discord!
